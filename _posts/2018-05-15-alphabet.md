The first method is to use the **Unicode Code Point** for the characters:
- 'a'=>97 to 'z'=>123
- 'A'=>65 to 'Z'=>91

Then we use the `ch()` function to get the character for **Unicode Code Point**...

The converse for the function is the `ord()` function. It returns the **Unicode Code Point** for a character.

OR 

You can use a nifty shortcut, using the `string` module and the `lowercase` list which already has the letters :P .
