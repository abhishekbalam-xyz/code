# Java

The program is simple, but the implementation needs some explaination. 

To take input from the program , we use the `Scanner` class, it is included as the `java.utils.Scanner`..

The class object needs to be initialized to use. The scanner object has the method `nextInt()` to take in an integer, as there is another method for `nextFloat()` or `nextLine()` to take in a string.

# Python

`input()` method is used which takes in the prompt as a String parameter.
