# Java

The program is simple, but the implementation needs some explaination. 

To take input from the program , we use the `Scanner` class, it is included as the `java.utils.Scanner`..

The class object needs to be initialized to use. The scanner object has the method `nextInt()` to take in an integer, as there is another method for `nextFloat()` or `nextLine()` to take in a string.

{% highlight java %}
import java.io.*;
import java.util.Scanner;

class Main{
    public static void main(String[] args){
        Scanner sc=new Scanner(System.in);
        int num;
        System.out.println("Enter number:");
        num=sc.nextInt();
        if(num%2==0){
            System.out.println("Number is Even");
        }
        else{
            System.out.println("Number is Odd");
        }
        
    }
}
{% endhighlight %}

# Python

`input()` method is used which takes in the prompt as a String parameter.

{% highlight java %}
num=input("Enter Number:")
if(num%2==0):
    print("Number is Even")
else:
    print("Number is Odd")
{% endhighlight %}
