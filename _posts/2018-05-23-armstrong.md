# Note

An Armstrong Number is a one in which the sum of individual numbers is equal to them raised to power of the number of digits.

For example for `153`:
- 153=1<sup>3</sup>+5<sup>3</sup>+3<sup>3</sup>

Other Armstrong Numbers: 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 153, 370, 371, 407, 1634, 8208, 9474, 54748 ...
