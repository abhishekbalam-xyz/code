# Introduction

It is a basic algorithm to sort numbers in an array in an **ascending order**.


# How It Works

For Ascending:
- It iterates through the array form index 0. It will check if the number at index `i` is **greater than** number at index `i+1` and swaps it. Then it moves to check for next position till its at the end of the array length.
For Descending: 
- It iterates through the array form index 0. It will check if the number at index `i` is **lesser than** number at index `i+1` and swaps it. Then it moves to check for next position till its at the end of the array length.
For Descending: 

We will do ascending only.
